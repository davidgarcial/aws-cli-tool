# Cloud Assignment IaaS and Python 

Hi, glad that you are reading this, sorry if its not the fancier code 
but its my first time in python and i make my best (dont be that hard xd)

So in order to launch the app python and boto3 are needed
* https://www.python.org/downloads/
* https://github.com/boto/boto3/

Then just target the main file with will redirect you to the login
> py main.py

You are able to create a new user or use one of the previously created

For create a user is necessary a user name,password,aws key,aws secret key 
and define if the user gonna be an admin or just a regular user
