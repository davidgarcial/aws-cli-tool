# Cloud Assignment IaaS (Python & Boto3)

Hi, I glad that you are reading this, sorry if it's not the fancier code 
Its my first time in python and i do my best (don't be that hard xd)

So in order to launch the app python and boto3 are needed
* https://www.python.org/downloads/
* https://github.com/boto/boto3

Then target the main file with will redirect you to the login
> py main.py

You are able to create a new user or use one of the previously created

In order to create a user is necessary a user name, password,aws key,aws secret key and define if the user gonna be an admin or just a regular user

If you provide empty values the program will exit
